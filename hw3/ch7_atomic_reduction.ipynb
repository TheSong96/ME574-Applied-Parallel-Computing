    "# Ch. 7 Global Thread Interactions and Reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapters 2 and 4 we looked at the simplest case of parallelization\n",
    "in which each thread performs an independent computation. In Chapters\n",
    "5 and 6 we consider thread interactions, where multiple\n",
    "threads share data, but limited the focus to __local__ interactions so that a thread shares data only with threads that lie close to it in the grid. The canonical local interaction problem involves stencil computations that arise from finite difference computations. Now we move on to the more general\n",
    "case of global interaction, where all the threads in the grid can\n",
    "contribute to a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.1 A Classic Reduction: The Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic problem of this variety involves computing the ___dot product___, also known as the ___inner product___ or ___scalar product__ because it produces a scalar value from two input vectors according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u \\cdot v = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_i * v_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product computation can be broken into two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute a new vector `w` whose entries are the product of the corresponding\n",
    "entries in `u` and `v`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sum the entries in `w` to get a single numerical result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step involves no thread interaction, so it fits the map pattern discussed earlier, and we have already seen how to effectively implement and parallelize such a computation using CUDA kernels. The summation in the second step involves global thread interaction. The array of elementwise product values is \"reduced\" to a smaller entity (here a single number), so all threads interact to produce a single result. This process is referred to as a __reduction__.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.2 Implementation with CUDA: Technical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore various approaches that span the gamut of effectiveness including:\n",
    "- infeasible\n",
    "- feasible, but unrealiable\n",
    "- reliable, but inefficient\n",
    "- reliable and efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, our main interest lies in the \"reliable and efficient\" methods, but it is enlightening to see how other approaches fall short of that standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by looking at a simple serial dot product implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def dot(u,v):\n",
    "    n = u.shape[0]\n",
    "    accum = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        accum += u[i] * v[i]\n",
    "    return accum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the serial code, the key idea involves creating a accumulator variable `accum` that is initialized to zero and successively incremented by the product of the elements stored at each value of the index `i`. It is tempting to try a similar approach to create a parallel version, but one very quickly runs into technical restrictions. When trying to create a parallel dot product that follows the serial model by creating and implementing an accumulation variable, a question immediately arises: \"Where would the accumulator variable be initialized and stored?\" In the serial version, the variable `accum` is created in host memory and it is accessible throughout the computation. This is not a feasible approach for a parallel version that runs on the device, since computations running on the device generally does not have access to host memory. How could we create an accumulation variable that resides on the device? Including the variable `accum` in the list of arguments passed to the kernel will create an accumulation variable on the device, however a variable passed to the kernel is stored in register memory associated with an individual thread. Each thread will have the variable `accum`, but each thread will have its own version of that variable and will not have access to the values stored in other versions of the variable associated with other threads. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we create a location to accumulate values that lives on the device and is accessible to all threads? Access by all threads points to global memory, and we can create storage in global memory by creating a device array. In the case of this simple reduction, we need to accumulate a single result, so the logical next step is to create `accum` as an array of length 1, copy it to global memory on the device, and allow each thread to add its contribution to the single element of `accum`. Sample code to implement this approach is show in Listings 7.1 and 7.2.\n",

    "Nothing about the naïve approach seems overtly incorrect but, when executed, the parallel dot product returns a value that is not only different than the serial result, but not even reproducible. The situation we have run into, when repeated execution of the same code produces different results, is referred to as a ___race condition___, a name whose origin should be clear shortly. On line 15 in the kernel, `d_accum[0] += w` instructs each thread to read the value stored in `d_accum[0]` in global memory, add to that value `w = d_u[i] * d_v[i]` (computed on line 14), and write the result back into the memory location for `d_accum[0]`. Unlike the serial version where this same set of operations occurs sequentially for increasing values of `i` (producing the desired result), here a large number of threads are all performing these operations concurrently. The thread with index `i` reads `accum[0]` with plans to increment the value and store the result  back in `accum[0]`, so another thread with index `j` can read the updated value and add its contribution to the accumulated value. However, that is not how things work in the asynchronous parallel world. When thread `i` reads the value of `accum[0]`, nothing stops other threads from reading the value of `accum[0]`. Whether the value stored there includes the contribution from thread `i` is not clearly determined; it depends on whether thread `i` happened to complete execution before or after thread `j` reads the value of `accum[0]]`. When multiple threads read the same value from `accum[0]`, the result that will be stored in `accum[0]` depends in an ill-defined and unpredictable way on which of the threads happened to finish execution last. The result cannot be known for sure. The only thing certain is that the stored result is wrong, because one or more of the results gets lost from the accumulated value. This undefined behavior associated with the uncertainty of the order of execution (where the observed results depend on which thread completes execution first) is the origin of the term \"race condition\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another situation where it is necessary to re-assert some control over the order of execution to ensure that correct results are obtained. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Recall that the efficiency of parallel computation is a result of giving up control over order of execution so the scheduler can assign tasks to keep the SMs busy and hide latency. Taking back control of execution order comes with a performance cost, and we should choose to pay that cost in situations where synchronization is necessary to obtain correct results, and this is one of those stiuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several mechanisms for controlling order of execution are supported in `numba.cuda`. In Ch. 5, we encountered a situation where we needed to ensure that shared arrays were fully loaded before threads proceeded with stencil computations, and `cuda.syncthreads()` was introduced as the appropriate method for that situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce the second mechanism: ___atomic operations___. To avoid the race conditions described above, we need to make sure that once a thread reads the value of the accumulator, that thread gets to complete the \"read-increment-write\" sequence before any other thread gets to read the value of the accumulator. This approach can be thought in terms of a \"lending library\" model: a \"borrower\" thread \"checks out\" the accumulator to read its value, and no other \"readers\" have access until the \"borrower\" thread completes the read-increment-write sequence and \"returns\" the variable so that it is available for the next borrower. The CUDA implementation of the lending library model is known as ___atomic operations___ which are \"atomic\" in the sense that the read-increment-write \"molecule\" of operations becomes a single \"atomic\" operation that cannot be subdivided into smaller components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing 7.3 shows the code from _apps/dot/atomic.py_ which includes an updated version of `dot_kernel`. The key change occurs on line 15 where `accum[0] += w` is replaced by `cuda.atomic.add(d_accum , 0, w)`. You should run the revised code and convince yourself that the revision employing atomic addition produces correct results that agree with the serial results.\n",

In the implementation shown in Listing 7.3, each thread includes an atomic operation that prevents any other thread from making progress (because the accumulator is unavailable to every other thread while it is checked out). Thus, inserting the single line that calls the atomic operation essentially causes the computation to be __completely serialized__ which is a very unsatisfactory outcome when aiming for parallelization. Is there some other tool available so that we can produce reliable results without completely giving up parallelization? The key again lies in thinking about the type and scope of available memory. We want to use atomic operations to produce reliable summation into global memory, but without having an atomic operation occur in every thread. The next section presents such an approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.3 Optimizing a Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Atomic operations are a useful tool for achieving reliable reductions but, when used as illustrated in Listing 7.3, they greatly\n",
    "defeat the purpose of parallelization. In this section we explore an approach that achieves reliability without unnecessary loss of efficiency by utilizing atomic operations together with shared memory as shown in Listing 7.4. The strategy behind the code is to take advantage of the ___key properties of shared memory arrays___: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rapid access\n",
    "- Accessible to all threads in a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental approach to efficiency improvement is a tiled or blocked approach where the necessary data is read from global memory and stored in a shared array so that the block can compute a \"block sum\" (the net contribution to the reduction result from data associated with all of the threads in the block). The block sum can then be reliably added to the accumulator in global memory with a single atomic operation for the entire block, rather than an atomic operation bor each thread. The number of atomic operations (each of which inhibits parallelism) is thus reduced by a factor equal to the number of threads in a block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining question involves how to sum the contributions from the threads in the block. The simplest approach is to assign a particular thread in the block to compute the block sum. A simple shared memory implementation is shown in Listing 7.4 below. The shared array `sh_w` is estabished on line 11 and line 12 initializes the entry corresponding to the thread index to zero. Line 14 performs an array bounds check, and the element producdt is computed and stored in the shared array on line 15. Again, we use the appropriate index for each array: `i` for the global memory arrays `d_u` and `d_v`, and `tIdx` for the shared memory array `sh_w`. On line 16, the call to `cuda.syncthreads()` ensures that every thread has computed its element product and stored the result in the shared array before the summation starts. Lines 17-21 instructs the thread with index 0 to loop over the thread indices, sum the entries in the shared array, and then `atomic.add` it into the global memory accumulator `d_accum[0]`.\n",

    "The sections above should provide an awareness of how to compute\n",
    "reductions and how one might optimize a reduction if performance\n",
    "is the foremost concern. However, implementing your own reduction\n",
    "is not entirely necessary. Reductions are used very frequently in the\n",
    "world of parallel computing. Numba has recognized this and have implemented their own built-in reduction decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Listing 7.6 illustrates a dot product using Numba’s `@cuda.reduce` decorator to implement the reduction. All that is needed to perform the reduction is to add the `@cuda.reduce` decorator to the function that describes what type of atomic operation you want to perform. Here we are performing a sum reduction so we indicate this by returning the sum of\n",
    "the arguments of the function. If we wanted to perform a maximum\n",
    "reduction we would replace `u + v` with `max(u, v)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only oddity that needs to be addressed is the argument mismatch\n",
    "between the `reduction()` call and the `reduction()` definition.\n",
    "In the function call we pass in the array we want to reduce. In the\n",
    "function definition, `u` and `v` represent how we compare the values\n",
    "within the array `d_w`. When the code is compiled the `@cuda.reduce`\n",
    "decorator will alter the function so that it can perform the reduction.\n",
