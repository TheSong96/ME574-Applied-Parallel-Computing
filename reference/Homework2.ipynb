    "### ME 574 Winter 2019 Homework 2\n",
    "### Due Thursday 31 January 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your work by uploading a Jupyter notebook via Canvas.\n",
    "Make sure that executing your notebook produces the intended results!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "0.1) Read Chapters 1 and 2 of S&U.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note some changes/adjustments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ch. 1: PyOpenGL and Pyside come into play for things like writing apps with interactive graphics. We will demonstrate this capability, but may not do much with it. In either case, you should not need to worry about these too much.\n",
    "* Section 1.1: New developments in user interface make it easier to get things done without doing much on the command line.\n",
    "* Section 1.2: If you have a computer with an NVIDIA GPU, set up should be greatly simplified. Installing Anaconda should have provided everything you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "0.2) Go to the CUDA Zone at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone and create an account so that you have access to CUDA developer materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "0.3) Go to The GPU Tech Conference (GTC) site https://on-demand-gtc.gputechconf.com/gtcnew/on-demand-gtc.php <br>Find an interesting video to watch. Here is a suggestion if you need one: http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2018/video/S8438/\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write python code to compute and print machine $\\epsilon$ (for CPU computations). Take the following approach: Write a ```for()``` loop to ompute $\\epsilon_n = 0.5^n$ for increasing integer values of $n$ up to a default limit of ```N_MAX = 100```. When $1. == 1. + \\epsilon_n$, store the values of $n$ and $\\epsilon_n$ terminate the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "2) This is the parallelized version of problem 1. Write  the following python code using ```numba```:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Write a device function to compute $0.5^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Write a kernel function that computes a `numpy` array of powers of $0.5$ by calling your device function.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Write a wrapper function to set up and launch the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Write a ```main()``` function that creates the ```numpy``` array, calls the wrapper function, and determines (and prints) the index and value corresponding to machine $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Execute your ```main()``` function to produce a value of machine $\\epsilon$ computed on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Modify your code (specifically the definition of your ```numpy``` array using the optional ```dtype``` argument) to use 32-bit data (instead of 64-bit) floating point numbers. Re-execute ```main()``` and discuss how the new 32-bit result compares withe 64-bit version.\n",
    "\n",
    "g) Modify your code so that the test for identifying the exponent & value and the print statement are done in parallel in the kernel function. Discuss the order in which results are printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "h) THINK ABOUT THIS PART, BUT DO NOT DO IT. WE WILL RETURN TO THIS ISSUE LATER... Finally modify your code from part f so the kernel saves the exponent and value to named variables, and the ouput is a single line giving the exponent and value corresponding to machine $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "3) This problem deals with the difference equation corresponding to Newton's method applied to the function $f(x) = x (x^2-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Determine the difference equation (you can do this by hand) and write a python function that takes an initial value of $x_n$ and computes the next iterate $x_{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Write python code using a ```for()``` loop to compute a sequence of iterates subject to termination criteria including a desired tolerance and a maximum iteration count.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Choose a few initial values and compute/plot the sequence of iterates. Illustrate each of the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i) Convergence to x= -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii) Convergence to x= 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iii) Convergence to x= 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    iv) Convince yourself that there is bounded but non-convergent behavior by finding a fixed point where $g(g(x)) = x$ but $g(x) \\neq x$. Find the relevant value(s) of $x$. Can you observe this behavior using your numerical iteration code? Why or why not?\n",
    "    \n",
    "***        \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Parallelize your code from Problem 2 using ```numba``` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) Convert your function to a device function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Instead of using a loop, launch a kernel function and store your results in a device array.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) Copy the array back to the host and check that it coincides with the serial version.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d) Plot the results and the difference between the serial and parallel versions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Shorghofer problem 4.5 which corresponds to Newton's method applied to the complex function $f(z) = z^3 - 1$. Again, obtain the difference equation by hand and rewrite it as a pair of difference equations (or a difference equation for a vector of length 2 with real components $x$ and $y$). The notebook you submit should include both code for a serial implementation using nested ```for()``` loops and the requested plot\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Parallelize your code from Problem 4 using ```numba``` by converting your iteration to a device function and replacing the nested loops with a kernel function that launches a 2D computational grid. Test whether the 2D array of values produced by the kernel agress with the serial version. Present (briefly discuss) the results of the comparison of serial and parallel results."
